This file is a space where we can list possible ideas for the app.

Feel free to add any ideas that would make a cool/useful/fun app for desktop or mobile. Since Android apps are written in Java, any ideas should be easily portable between desktop OSs and Android, but I guess we'll find out once we actually try to do it.

After we have a few ideas, we'll vote on the best one.
