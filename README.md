## Game Play

Click a piece to move it. Available moves will be highlighted. If you click a square that is not highlighted, you will encounter an error message. Each player has one move per turn. The object of the game is to remove all of their opponent's pieces from the game by jumping them. Pieces are "Kinged" when they reach the last row of the board on their opponent's side. Kinged pieces can move backwards as well as forward.
